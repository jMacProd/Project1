##2018 - this is a number of the 2018 files then used to move towards the final clean data set

## clean_data_rs - contains all final and clean csv files

## data_files store - miscellaneouse files that we collected in the beginning that were useful but did not form part of the final clean_data set

## OccupancyQuesionts_JS - workings along the way as we battled with occupancy, how to calculate it, how useful was it

## Presentation Slides - putting together our final presentation, several versions in here, now includes the 'price output folder of slides'

## The code then appears, numbered in the order in which it would be expected to run
#### 1. trains.ipynb
